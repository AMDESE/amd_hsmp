AMD HSMP DRIVER README

The HSMP driver is an experimental kernel module for providing userspace
and kernel access to the Host System Management Port on AMD systems.
Initially this module is supported only on AMD family 19h models.


-----------
| WARNING |
-----------

The hsmp driver provides a module parameter to allow the driver to run
on AMD family 17h models. This is considered experimental and should
only be used by individuals who understand the Host System Management
Port and what it controls. HSMP allows changing of certain platform
operational parameters after UEFI. Such changes may be different than the
UEFI settings and changes effected by HSMP will not be reflected back to
the UEFI menus. In addition, the BMC can also change some of the same
parameters. Except where expressly detailed in the HSMP specification,
the result of concurrent HSMP and BMC changes to these parameters may
result in unexpected results for these parameters.

Update for Version 0.95-internal
----------------------

Several updates have been made in the 0.95-internal version of the
amd_hsmp driver. Most of these updates should be transparent to users
of the driver, but there are a couple of changes users need to be aware of.

First, the sysfs interface has moved from /sys/devices/system/cpu/amd_hsmp
to /sys/devices/platform/amd_hsmp. This is a result of the driver
being converted to a platform driver, plus this is a better home
for the sysfs interfaces.

Second, the sysfs file for 'nbio_pstate' has moved. Previously the
driver created a sysfs directory at /sys/.../amd_hsmp/pci000:XX
that had the nbio_pstate file in it. The pci000:XX directories
are no longer created and the 'nbio_pstate' file now lives in a
per-NBIO directory under the socketX directories;
/sys/.../amd_hsmp/socketX/nbioY where X is the socket number
and Y is the NBIO id. Under this new directory live the nbio_pstate
file and a file describing the bus range (i.e. 00 - 3F) for
the NBIO.

Interface
---------

See amd_hsmp.h for descriptions of the kernel API.
See amd_hsmp.c for details about the SysFS interface.


Build and Install
-----------------

Kernel development packages for the running kernel need to be installed
prior to building the HSMP driver. A Makefile is provided which should
work with most kernel source trees.

To build the kernel module:

#> make

To install the kernel module:

#> sudo make modules_install

To clean the kernel module build directory:

#> make clean


Loading
-------

If the HSMP driver was installed you should use the modprobe command to
load the driver.

#> sudo modprobe amd_hsmp

The HSMP driver can also be loaded using insmod if the driver was not
installed:

#> sudo insmod ./amd_hsmp.ko


Testing
-------

A test harness is provided that does base level testing of the userspace
and kernel interfaces via hsmp_test.sh and hsmp_test.ko respectively.
The hsmp_test.sh script will exercise all of the userspace interfaces
and load the hsmp_test.ko module to test the kernel interfaces.

To build and run the test harness:

#> make test

#> sudo ./hsmp_test.sh
