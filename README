This is an experimental driver for the AMD Host System Management Port.

Initially this is supported only on AMD family 17h models 30h-3fh 2nd
generation "EPYC" code name "Rome".

See amd_hsmp.h for descriptions of the kernel API.
See amd_hsmp.c for details about the SysFS interface.

You will need the kernel development package for the running kernel. Build the
module using the kernel's KBuild system as follows:

make -C <path_to_compiled_kernel_source_or_development_package> M=$PWD

Note the default make target using the above syntax is "modules" so it is not
necessary to explicitly specify this.

If building for the running kernel, you may also be able to use

make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=$PWD

A KBuild clean target is also supported:

make -C <path_to_compiled_kernel_source_or_development_package> M=$PWD clean

or

make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=$PWD clean

A convenience wrapper Makefile is included allowing the module to be built with
a simple make, and cleaned with a simple make clean.
