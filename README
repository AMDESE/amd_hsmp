AMD HSMP DRIVER README

The HSMP driver is an experimental kernel module for providing userspace
and kernel access to the Host System Management Port on AMD systems.
Initially this module is supported only on AMD family 17h models 30h-3fh
2nd generation "EPYC" code name "Rome".


-----------
| WARNING |
-----------

This is considered an experimental driver and should only be used by
individuals who understand the Host System Management Port and what it
controls. HSMP allows changing of certain platform operational parameters
after UEFI. Such changes may be different than the UEFI settings and
changes effected by HSMP will not be reflected back to the UEFI menus. In
addition, the BMC can also change some of the same parameters. Except where
expressly detailed in the HSMP specification, the result of concurrent HSMP
and BMC changes to these parameters may result in unexpected results for
these parameters.


Interface
---------

See amd_hsmp.h for descriptions of the kernel API.
See amd_hsmp.c for details about the SysFS interface.


Build and Install
-----------------

Kernel development packages for the running kernel need to be installed
prior to building the HSMP driver. A Makefile is provided which should
work with most kernel source trees.

To build the kernel module:

#> make

To install the kernel module:

#> sudo make modules_install

To clean the kernel module build directory:

#> make clean


Loading
-------

If the HSMP driver was installed you should use the modprobe command to
load the driver.

#> sudo modprobe amd_hsmp

The HSMP driver can also be loaded using insmod if the driver was not
installed:

#> sudo insmod ./amd_hsmp.ko


Testing
-------

A test harness is provided that does base level testing of the userspace
and kernel interfaces via hsmp_test.sh and hsmp_test.ko respectively.
The hsmp_test.sh script will exercise all of the userspace interfaces
and load the hsmp_test.ko module to test the kernel interfaces.

To build and run the test harness:

#> make test

#> sudo ./hsmp_test.sh
